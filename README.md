This application was created in ReactJS. It is an online organizational workspace application. The app has multiple features grouped into three tabs: My Documents, Schedule, and Community. The "My Documents" tab allows the user to create documents in the app, upload their own PDF files, and create folders to rganize their documents. The "Schedule" tab has a calendar that the user can use to create events including the event name, event time, and event details. From here the user cna add as many events, edit them if needed, and delete them when desired. In the "Community" tab, the user can see what everyone else on the app is saying. It is a community-wide chat room where any and every user can write something and post it for everyone to see.
